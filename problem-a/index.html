    <h1>The Eleventh Doctor</h1>
    <img src="img/doctor.jpg" alt="An image of the 11th Doctor, played by Matt Smith">

    <p>This is the 11th incarnation of the time-travelling alien from Gallifrey, the Doctor.
        Commonly travelling through space-time with companions (mostly Amy Pond), this popular character is from 
        Seasons 5 to 7 of the show <cite><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436992/">Doctor Who</a></cite>.
        Known for his signature bow tie and armed with his sonic screwdriver, the Doctor is the defender of 
        life in the galaxy but he's usually on Earth defending his favourite beings: humans.

    <h2>3 things I admire about the Doctor</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>His goofy, quirky, funny personality in the face of utter doom.</li>
        <li>His compassionate nature to all beings, even those who have done wrong.</li>
        <li>His ability to think on his feet to solve the most difficult moral situations.</li>
    </ol>
